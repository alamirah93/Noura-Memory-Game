# Noura Memory Game
Train your skills and train your memory with my great memory games.

## Important Notes
- Made as a project as a part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.
- Used a [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) provided from Udacity with some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project.
- I converted this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
